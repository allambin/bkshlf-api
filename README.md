# BKSHLF

## Overview

This project is a **Goodreads API clone** built using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. The main purpose of this project is to serve as a learning exercise for me to deepen my understanding of these technologies. **Please note that this project is not intended to be a fully functional or complete application.**

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Learn and practice Java programming.
- Gain hands-on experience with Spring Boot.

## Disclaimer

This project is a **work in progress** and will **never be completed**. It is not meant to be a production-ready application or a comprehensive clone of the Goodreads API. As such, you may find incomplete features, missing documentation, or other limitations.

## Acknowledgements

- This project is inspired by [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) and its API, but it is purely for educational purposes.
- I would like to thank the open-source community and contributors of Java and Spring Boot projects, as their work has greatly helped me in this learning journey.

**Thank you for understanding the purpose of this project.**
